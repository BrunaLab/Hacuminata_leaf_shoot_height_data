This repository is to clean and organize data on the size of individual _Heliconia acuminata_ plants. For each plant there are data on the total number of leaves, shoots, the areas of each leaf, the total leaf area of the plant, and the plant height.


This dataset is from an experiment to test for costs of reproduction in H acuminata conducted during 1998-1999 field season. The experiment was not particularly well thought out; at the time I knew little about HA and in retrospect I don't theink the fertilizer applications were particularly effective.
