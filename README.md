This repository is to clean and organize data on leaf length, leaf area (individual leaves, total plant leaf area), shoot number, and height of _Heliconia acuminata_ plants found at reserve 1501 of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (Manaus, Brazil).

The data are from a pilot study testing for costs of reproduction in *H. acuminata* conducted during 1998-1999 field season. Plants were assigned to one of four treatments: (1) fertilizer addition + manually hand-pollinate all open flowers with pollen from other plants, (2) Manually hand-pollinate, (3) fertilizer addition, (4) Control plants. At the time I knew relatively little about _H. acuminata_ growth and reproduction; I soon realized the treatments were unlikely to be effective because of the way the fertilizer was being applied and the difficulty I was having hand pollinating plants. However, the data set has value for its detailed breakdown of plant allometry. For each plant I measured:

1. Height to the top of the tallest leaf
2. Number of shoots
3. The length of all leaves
4. Production of flowers, fruits, and seeds

Using No. 3 one can then calculate:

5. Total leaf number
6. Area of each leaf (using the regression equation found in [Bruna et al. 2002](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3072265))
7. Total plant leaf area
