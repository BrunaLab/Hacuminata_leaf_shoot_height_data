This repository is to clean and organize data on the size of individual _Heliconia acuminata_ plants. For each plant there are data on the total number of leaves, shoots, the areas of each leaf, the total leaf area of the plant, and the plant height.


This dataset is from an experiment to test for costs of reproduction in H. acuminata conducted during 1998-1999 field season. The experiment was not particularly well thought out and I ended it after a few months (at the time I knew relatively little about _H. acuminata_ growth and reproduction; I soon realized the treatments were unlikely to be effective). However, the dataset does have value for it's detailed breakdown of plant size. For each plant we measured:

1. Height to the top of the tallest leaf
2. Number of shoots
3. The length of all leaves
4. Production of flowers, fruits, and seeds

Using No. 3 one can calculate:

5. Total leaf number
6. Area of each leaf (using a regression equation calculated with [these data](10.6084/m9.figshare.92691))
7. Total plant leaf area


Plants were assigned to one of four treatments: 

1. Add fertilizer, mannually hand-pollinate
2. Manually hand-pollinate
3. Add fertilizer
4. Control (no pollen, no fertilizer)
